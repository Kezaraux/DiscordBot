Installation
------------

Please be sure to run `npm i --vs2015 -g windows-build-tools` **BEFORE** running `npm install` otherwise you will encounter issues.

Once you've ran `npm install`, copy `dummy.json` found in the `config` folder and rename it to `default.json`. Fill out each field as appropriate.

You can enable or disable them by flagging them `true` or `false` in the config respectively.
